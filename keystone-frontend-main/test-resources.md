# Resources Functionality Test Guide

## ✅ What I've Fixed

1. **Router Context Error** - Fixed App.js to properly use BrowserRouter
2. **Missing Routes** - Added resources routes back to AppRoutes
3. **Missing Navigation** - Added Resources link back to navbar
4. **File Structure** - Restored proper separation of App.js and AppRoutes

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Test the Main App
- Open http://localhost:3000
- You should see the loading screen, then the main app
- No more "useRoutes() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component" error

### 2. Test Resources Navigation
- Look for "Resources" in the main navigation menu
- Click on "Resources" - should navigate to `/resources`

### 3. Test Resources Page
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/resources
- You should see:
  - Hero section with "Resource Library" title
  - Grid of 6 sample resources
  - Each resource has a "DOWNLOAD NOW →" button

### 4. Test Download Flow
- Click "DOWNLOAD NOW →" on any resource
- Should navigate to `/resources/download/1` (or similar)
- Fill out the form:
  - Name: Test User
  - Email: test@example.com
  - Phone: 123-456-7890
- Click "Submit & Get Download"
- Should see success message

### 5. Test Back Navigation
- Click "← Back to Resources" 
- Should return to resources page

## 🔧 If You Still See Issues

### Check Console Errors
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Look for any red error messages
- The Router error should be gone

### Verify File Structure
- App.js should import AppRoutes from "./routes/AppRoutes"
- App.js should wrap everything in <Router>
- AppRoutes should contain the resources routes
- Navbar should have the Resources link

### Restart Development Server
```bash
# Kill existing processes
pkill -f "npm start"

# Start fresh
npm start
```

## 📁 Current File Status

- ✅ App.js - Fixed with proper Router structure
- ✅ AppRoutes.js - Contains resources routes
- ✅ Navbar.js - Contains Resources navigation link
- ✅ ResourcesPage.js - Complete with sample data
- ✅ ResourceDownloadPage.js - Complete with form and download logic

## 🎯 Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. No more Router context errors
2. Resources page loads with sample content
3. Download flow works end-to-end
4. Navigation between pages works smoothly
5. All routes are accessible

The resources functionality should now be fully working!
