      "As a serial entrepreneur, I’ve spent my career building innovative companies that drive impact. I co-founded Criterion Systems in 2005 and led it for nearly two decades as CEO, growing it into a recognized cybersecurity leader before its acquisition in 2023.",
      "After Criterion, I wasn’t finished building. With Keystone International Ventures, I envision something broader—a private equity platform that merges my passion for technology with a desire to invest in industries that reflect my values: creativity, service, and meaningful impact.",
      "At Keystone, we’re building more than businesses—we’re delivering transformative solutions and driving meaningful impact across industries. I believe deeply in the power of business as a force for good. Keystone Media channels my long-standing interest in entertainment through investments in film and television, including a series inspired by my 45-year journey in corporate leadership. Keystone Healthcare focuses on expanding access to affordable, life-saving treatments in underserved global markets. Our hospitality ventures foster community and connection through curated dining experiences.",
      "Keystone was born from this vision: a private equity platform that invests in emerging technologies and other high-impact industry verticals such as hospitality, media, healthcare and more; reflecting my commitment to creativity, service, and making a difference worldwide. Keystone represents a new chapter—one rooted in purpose. We’re not just investing in the future—we’re shaping it.",
